## Introduction

This CloudBank Solution consists of our notes on following High Performance Computing (HPC) tutorials on multiple cloud platforms.
Our requirement for this process is that the solution we build has to use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and a non-trivial 
problem to solve such as the Navier-Stokes equation applied to fluid dynamics.


Here are the links we followed to get started, by cloud provider.
